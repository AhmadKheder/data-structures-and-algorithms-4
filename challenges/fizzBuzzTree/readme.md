Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original,


## Challenge


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
this Challenge take from me 60 min  to do it ,
i use a function to do the challenge

## FizzBuzzTree

* Big O for time is O(n) 
* Big O for space is O(n)
